"The care and the level of service was awesome. The amazing attention to the level of details paid by the crew to each passenger was noteworthy. It felt like if you're flying a private jet. Having a Flight Chef on board makes a great deal of difference in the level of service."  },

"I absolutely loved it, seats were very comfortable, food is exquisite, and I absolutely loved the napkins to clean the teeth. The flight entertainment can be a bit more diversified and recent. At the check in counter the lady was very sweet and helpful. Keep up the good work, and looking forward for my next trip."  },

"I used to travel on Saudia then I switched to Emirates due to incline in the service level, but my two recent trips have changed my mind completely. From check in counter to Aircraft condition, food and beverages to the arrival and collecting the luggage is all smooth."  }
